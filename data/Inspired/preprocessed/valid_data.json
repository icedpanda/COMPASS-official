How about you?\nRecommender: Great! I'm here to help you find a movie trailer. Do you have any movie preferences?\nUser: I love comedies and dramas. Do you have a recommendation?\nRecommender: Yes. I just watched Light Night starring Emma Thompson and Mindy Kaling. It was pretty funny and a fun female comedy.\nUser: I have never heard of it, but I like both of the actresses. Can you tell me a bit about the story line?\nRecommender: Mindy Kaling's character is a quality control speciality at a plant, but she wants to get into comedy writing. The story centers on her getting a job for Emma Thompson's character, who is a talk show host and really hard to work for.\nUser: That sounds pretty good. I accept your recommendation.\nRecommender: Awesome! I hope you enjoy watching the trailer.\nUser: Thank you! I am sure I will.\nRecommender: Do you want me to recommend a drama movie as well?\nUser: Yes please!\nRecommender: I watched a movie about a month ago that was a drama/comedy that had me dying of laughter. It's called What we did on our holiday.\nUser: Interesting. I have never heard of that either. Is it a Christmas movie? Or do they mean holiday as in vacation?\nRecommender: It's british, so they mean vacation. It has David Tennant and Rosamund Pike. They play a couple on the brink of divorce who take their kids to his dying father's 75th birthday in Scotland.\nUser: I LOVE David Tennant so I would watch it just for that!

This holiday season brings a couple of suspense flicks to the screen: one of them is Knives out. with a current score of 98% on rotten tomatoes it is sure to be a hit\nUser: I saw that one already. It has good parts and a great twist, but it tends to drag.\nRecommender: i understand, so Last Christmas with Emilia Clarke from Game of Thrones interestes you?\nUser: Yes, it sounds like a good movie.\nRecommender: excellent, i hope you enjoy the trailer\nUser: Thanks. What I've seen has been good so far.\nRecommender: here is a little sniped of the movie\nUser: Huh? I don't see the link. What happened to it?\nRecommender: Kate is a young woman subscribed to bad decisions. Her last date with disaster? That of having accepted to work as Santa's elf for a department store. However, she meets Tom there. Her life takes a new turn. For Kate, it seems too good to be true.\nUser: Do they say in the movie why she's so inclined to bad decisions?\nRecommender: she(Emilia Clarke) just seem to make bad decision after another. Part of the whole Rom Com thing  i guess.\nUser: Is it super cheesy like most rom coms, with some speech to a bunch of random people, that most people wouldn't do in real life?\nRecommender: no it really seams to be a good movie, the cast is good and the truth is that movies like this only are good around Christmas. i hope you enjoy your movie\nUser: Do you have any other good recommendations?", "context_entities": [1448, 4044, 4041, 1006, 893, 4033, 1554, 2773, 4795, 5215, 1130, 796, 1692, 2346], "context_words": [10919, 4702, 23921, 54468, 45934, 15096, 31175, 49143, 41451, 2835, 56117, 4547, 53346, 23749, 15237, 1513, 41826, 2115, 5993, 26759, 42504, 35050, 742, 14603, 44191, 37427, 56398, 39690, 47901, 16094, 551, 6226, 26087, 23405, 56119, 3509, 11026, 27649, 46414, 33498, 3965, 4902, 4301, 47863, 24858, 14764, 44093, 271, 17272, 50785, 36309, 3682, 51264, 50869, 49758, 22100, 50754, 43717, 31991, 21642, 38399, 50703, 14336, 30484, 55728, 33451, 26420, 39741, 18460, 10629, 38401, 41827, 24611, 31068, 10062, 15934, 20850, 46813, 35176, 927, 6042, 49656, 52508, 22094, 18996, 29499, 8657, 36100, 1965, 12051, 28469, 29441, 13834, 43417, 21978, 52689, 43953, 43701, 33447, 6323, 50216, 42739, 56361, 15573, 31469, 26109, 4568, 8520, 18838, 29688, 17188, 28626, 24749, 21293, 48079, 50370, 45263, 42472, 6202, 34702, 21923, 35394, 12682, 20281, 3796, 12918, 1287, 12525, 28426, 29069, 18155, 44078, 21418, 18458, 19535, 52885, 38172, 16344, 11253, 3840, 34515, 7871, 5500, 20546, 30918, 20505, 8989, 39808, 40042, 41458, 25707, 22201, 1707, 39179, 17642, 19035, 53486, 6496, 6490, 39419, 17273], "context_items": [893, 1448, 1006, 1554, 1130, 796, 1692], "response": "Recommender: i just watched Frozzen @ this Friday it was really good, Pretty funny to be honest", "utterance_id": 195, "items": [997]}, {"role": "User", "context": "Recommender: Hey there, how are you?", "context_entities": [], "context_words": [13834, 17526, 41458, 19035], "context_items": [], "response": "User: Great!

But I also liked John Wick for the mindless violence and action lol\nRecommender: Noted i'll have to check more into Ready or Not. I am a big fan of John Wick. The first movie that came to mind is Joker. In reference to thinking about society.\nUser: Which Joker Movie? The one with Health Ledger or the most recent movie?\nRecommender: The most recent movie. It's just called 'Joker'. Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend.\nUser: Interested. I do love dark movies and dark humor as well. Would you mind being more specific in terms of how they portray societies role? In other words, whom do they take stabs at? LOL\nRecommender: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything.\nUser: Ha ha ha. Fair enough. My fear with that movie was that it would turn out like Suicide Squad which had great potential but fell far short from expectations. I also stray away from comic book movies, however DC has kept me more entertained with how dark they seem to be. Would you say that this movie would be closer to Suicide Squad, or closer to the Dark Knight?\nRecommender: Suicide Squad was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure.

So tell what is something you watched recently and loved?\nUser: hmmm lol not a lot of great stuff. I think the last movie that I felt satisfied with was Ready or Not. But I also liked John Wick for the mindless violence and action lol\nRecommender: Noted i'll have to check more into Ready or Not. I am a big fan of John Wick. The first movie that came to mind is Joker. In reference to thinking about society.\nUser: Which Joker Movie? The one with Health Ledger or the most recent movie?\nRecommender: The most recent movie. It's just called 'Joker'. Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend.\nUser: Interested. I do love dark movies and dark humor as well. Would you mind being more specific in terms of how they portray societies role? In other words, whom do they take stabs at? LOL\nRecommender: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything.\nUser: Ha ha ha. Fair enough. My fear with that movie was that it would turn out like Suicide Squad which had great potential but fell far short from expectations. I also stray away from comic book movies, however DC has kept me more entertained with how dark they seem to be. Would you say that this movie would be closer to Suicide Squad, or closer to the Dark Knight?\nRecommender: Suicide Squad was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real.\nUser: EXCELLENT!! you had me sold when you said Suicide squad was garbage! I accept your recommendation. I saw the Director also said to watch it as a completely independent movie as well. Is this movie friendly for the more religious side of ones family? I have a few Zealots and want to know what too expect so I can stave off their constant state of being offended lol.\nRecommender: I don't remember any direct talk of any religion really. But i am biased i'm pretty agnostic so i dont watch for it much. I'd be more worried about becoming anarchist after watching it then any religious aspect.\nUser: Noted.

So tell what is something you watched recently and loved?\nUser: hmmm lol not a lot of great stuff. I think the last movie that I felt satisfied with was Ready or Not. But I also liked John Wick for the mindless violence and action lol\nRecommender: Noted i'll have to check more into Ready or Not. I am a big fan of John Wick. The first movie that came to mind is Joker. In reference to thinking about society.\nUser: Which Joker Movie? The one with Health Ledger or the most recent movie?\nRecommender: The most recent movie. It's just called 'Joker'. Joaquin Phoenix plays the joker from before he is joker and show hows society plays a big role in turning him into a psychopath essentially. Its very dark with good balance of humor. Highly recommend.\nUser: Interested. I do love dark movies and dark humor as well. Would you mind being more specific in terms of how they portray societies role? In other words, whom do they take stabs at? LOL\nRecommender: It shows in a lot a way. Just how people treat him. How the rich exploit people for money. It's all there to some degree if you watch for it. There is more im just trying my hardest not spoil anything.\nUser: Ha ha ha. Fair enough. My fear with that movie was that it would turn out like Suicide Squad which had great potential but fell far short from expectations. I also stray away from comic book movies, however DC has kept me more entertained with how dark they seem to be. Would you say that this movie would be closer to Suicide Squad, or closer to the Dark Knight?\nRecommender: Suicide Squad was garbage. Honestly i would try and look at this movie detached from the batman franchise completely. Even tho its does have easter eggs for those fans this is way to good to even lump with them. If you're familiar with Joaquin Phoenix expect a quality that only he can achieve. It a performance for sure. Not like health ledger way more real.\nUser: EXCELLENT!! you had me sold when you said Suicide squad was garbage! I accept your recommendation. I saw the Director also said to watch it as a completely independent movie as well. Is this movie friendly for the more religious side of ones family? I have a few Zealots and want to know what too expect so I can stave off their constant state of being offended lol.\nRecommender: I don't remember any direct talk of any religion really. But i am biased i'm pretty agnostic so i dont watch for it much. I'd be more worried about becoming anarchist after watching it then any religious aspect.\nUser: Noted. Well I certainly appreciate the recommendation! Any other last second recommendations? I mean you love John Wick and the Joker I was already considering but hadn't decided.

Also as far Joaquin Phoenix goes the movie 'Her' is fantastic and will make you cry. lol\nUser: I have heard of the movie Her. I will also watch that one. I really appreciate the recomendations. A lot of junk out there and no real guidance. Thank you and take care.\nRecommender: I hope you like them. You too.\nUser: one last thing!! What is Ex Machina about?\nRecommender: About this guy who goes on a secret job at some genius's house to help him see if his AI passed the turing test.\nUser: I was reading about it while you replied earlier an It was not very clear lol . You said sifi, futuristic I presume?\nRecommender: Yes but not to far future. Im a sucker for science fiction.

At the same time, businesses are destroying the jungle. Mostly drama, I thought it was pretty good.\nUser: Nice, I'll have to check that one out.\nRecommender: An older movie, 1992. Also starring Lorraine Bracco. The chemistry between Lorraine Bracco and Sean Connery is kind of funny.\nUser: Oh ok, I've heard of her as well. I'm a huge sean connery fan so I'll definitely have to find that one as well. Thanks!\nRecommender: I hope you enjoy it. The scenery is going to be quite different than that of Finding Forrester. Mostly takes place in the rain forest, I believe somewhere in South America. The two scientists are pretty isolated.\nUser: I just looked it up and it's pretty awesome seeing Sean Connery with super long hair.

Is there a specific type of horror movies you enjoy?\nUser: So glad you asked. Yes there is. I like  monster movies, like The Thing, and sci-fi  horror movies like Underworld, and Dracula 2000. I grew up watching those types of movies. Not into movies like QUOTATION_MARKSawQUOTATION_MARK and QUOTATION_MARKThe PurgeQUOTATION_MARK. Horror movies with good plots, lots of action  and suspense, and eventually at the end of the movie, how the animal  or monster is caught and obliterated.\nRecommender: I love sci-fi horror too! All of those are great movies. I particularly like the Alien movies. Sygourney Weaver is a fantastic actress.\nUser: It's amazing you should say that about the Alien movies. I've seen every last one of them, including the last one, but I'm still having a hard time trying to figure out what REALLY happened to Walter and David on Alien: Covenant. Sygourney Weaver is an awesome actress, I do agree. I personally really do enjoy movies where people turn into monsters, like the old movie, The Beast Within. It's kinda cheesy, but it does have a great story line to it. Waiting on a part two. Good to know that we share something in common!\nRecommender: I have seen all of them as well! Personally, regarding Alien: Covenant, I think that there is a chance that Walter is still alive since he had the ability to heal himself. I'm not so sure about David. Maybe they will continue the story. I hope so. Old monster movies are great too. I love cheese as food and in my movies. If you love movies like that I would suggest Pumpkinhead. It's an excellent cult classic!\nUser: Hmmm...I've seen a trailer or two for Pumpkinhead. I do enjoy cult classics like that. I think I will possibly take your recommendation on watching it. As a matter of fact, I'll see if I can find where I can buy it so I can watch it without commercials. And yeah, I do hope they continue the story with David and Walter. It is probably a chance that Walter is still alive. But thank you so much for your suggestion and recommendation, I greatly appreciate it.\nRecommender: I am glad I could help you find something you are interested in!

I like to watch them to see how scary they actually are or to laugh when they're not.\nRecommender: Nice. Do you follow any horror series? Or do you prefer original stories?\nUser: I've done both. I've found a few series I followed for a little while\nRecommender: Okay, what about reboots or adaptations? Any strong feelings about those kind of re-imaginings or older properties?\nUser: I will give any thing at least a chance.\nRecommender: Okay, I've got an idea. It's definitely one that could go either way, but it's got potential. Have you heard anything about Gretel & Hansel?\nUser: I heard something about it on tv when I was just walking past. I didn't hear too much.\nRecommender: Well, it's a riff off the classic Grimm's Fairy Tale, but this version fleshes the story out a lot more into an even more twisted tale.
