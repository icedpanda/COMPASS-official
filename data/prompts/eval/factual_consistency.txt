Evaluate the factual consistency of the generated user preference summary.
Focus on how accurately it reflects information from the conversation history and the knowledge graph, especially the keywords from "overall preferences" and "current interests".

Your evaluation should consider:

- **Alignment with Conversation History:** Does the summary accurately capture the user's expressed preferences and interests from the conversation?
- **Consistency with Knowledge Graph:** Are the "overall preferences" and "current interests" keywords are supported by the knowledge graph content?
- **Absence of Incorrect or Unsupported Claims:** Ensure the summary does not include incorrect information or claims not supported by the conversation history or knowledge graph, considering acceptable expansions.

Scoring Guidelines:

90-100: Excellent factual consistency with no significant issues. The summary accurately reflects the conversation and knowledge graph, including any reasonable expansions.

70-89: Good factual consistency with minor issues. The summary mostly reflects the conversation and knowledge graph, with minor inaccuracies or unsupported expansions.

50-69: Fair factual consistency with noticeable issues. The summary has some inaccuracies, unsupported claims, or unreasonable expansions.

30-49: Poor factual consistency with significant problems. The summary includes significant inaccuracies, unsupported claims, or unreasonable expansions.

0-29: Very poor factual consistency with critical failures. The summary is largely inconsistent with the conversation and knowledge graph, containing many incorrect or unsupported claims.
